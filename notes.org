* Device Behaviour

1. Startup
2. Check in with server by sending device info
   - hwaddr
   - capabilities
3. Push values
This is probably good to do first as the server can process data if needed before we get the values.
4. Get values

* TODO List
- [ ] Refactor out generic request logic
- [ ] put display logic in seperate task from http client logic
- [ ] Display values recieved from the server
- [ ] Startup log on display atop splash image

* Local Network Configuration
Would like to have a DNS server running locally to provide named hosts for the connecting devices to use.
