# Homestead Client
A device on your homestead.

## Known Problems

Release builds currently don't seem to get past the splash screen.

## Getting Started

Get ready to build and flash.

1. Install nightly, toolchain, and probe-rs.

``` shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup override set nightly
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
cargo install probe-run
cargo install --features=cli probe-rs
```

2. Download the two Wi-Fi binary blobs from this folder for flashing to the board.
https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/cyw43-firmware
Flash them with `probe-rs` as described below.

``` shell
probe-rs download --format bin --chip RP2040 --base-address 0x101C0000 43439A0.bin
probe-rs download --format bin --chip RP2040 --base-address 0x101f8400 43439A0_clm.bin 
```

3. Set the following environment variables in .cargo/config.toml
  - WIFI_SSID
  - WIFI_PASSWORD
  - URL is that of the homestead-server 
4. Good to go. Project can now build via `cargo build` and can run with `cargo run` to flash and get logs from the board.
Debugging performed via `cargo embed`. Programming devices via `cargo flash`.
