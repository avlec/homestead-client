# Homestead Client
A device on your homestead.

## Getting Started
1. Install nightly, toolchain, and probe-rs.
``` shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup override set nightly
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
cargo install probe-run
cargo install --features=cli probe-rs
```
2. Clone down the embassy repo and update the paths in main.rs.
Works for now but looking for a way to improve this.
